/* Implement a function that adds two numbers together and returns their sum in binary. The conversion can be done before, or after the addition.

The binary number returned should be a string.

Examples:(Input1, Input2 --> Output (explanation)))

1, 1 --> "10" (1 + 1 = 2 in decimal or 10 in binary)
5, 9 --> "1110" (5 + 9 = 14 in decimal or 1110 in binary)
 */

                                    //  Pseudo:
//add the two numbers
//convert the sum to binary
//->// loop through dividing by 2 (div) and get the remainder
