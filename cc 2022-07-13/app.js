/*                                              Kata Task

I have a cat and a dog.

I got them at the same time as kitten/puppy. That was humanYears years ago.

Return their respective ages now as [humanYears,catYears,dogYears]

NOTES:

humanYears >= 1
humanYears are whole numbers only
Cat Years
15 cat years for first year
+9 cat years for second year
+4 cat years for each year after that
Dog Years
15 dog years for first year
+9 dog years for second year
+5 dog years for each year after that

const humanYearsCatYearsDogYears = (humanYears) => {
    let catYears = 0
    let dogYears = 0
    for(let i = 1; i <= humanYears ;i++){
        if(i==1){
            catYears += 15
            dogYears += 15
        }else if(i==2){
            catYears += 9
            dogYears += 9
        }else{
            catYears += 4
            dogYears += 5
